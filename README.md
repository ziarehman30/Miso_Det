# Multimodal Framework for Misogyny Detection

A significant amount of offensive content on social media targets women. Traditional methods for detecting general offensive content often struggle to effectively identify misogynistic content, highlighting the need for specialized solutions that address this issue. In response, we propose a novel multimodal framework designed specifically for the detection of misogynistic and sexist content. This framework consists of three key modules: the Multimodal Attention Network Module (MANM), the Graph-based Feature Reconstruction Module (GFRM), and the Content-specific Features Learning Module (CFLM). Together, these modules work in tandem to enhance the detection and understanding of harmful content directed at women.
